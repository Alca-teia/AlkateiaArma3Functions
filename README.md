# Introduction
This repository contains virtually all functions I programmed throughout my journey as a mission editor in Arma 3. Every function has its description detailing its inner workings for ease of use. It is strongly advised to have a fundamental understanding in sqf scripting before applying my functions.

# How To Install
Download the .zip file containg the functions folder and extract it in your mission folder and add the following code in description.ext:

```
class CfgFunctions {
	#include "Alkateia Functions\functions.sqf"
};
```
# How To Use Functions
Every function has its description detailing its inner workings. The description and code can be accessed from within arma 3's function library in eden editor or by opening the function with a text editor (ex Notepad++ or Visual Code)
